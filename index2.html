                <p>The Ishihahra® Color Blindness Test is a self-assessment tool to measure type and extent of color
                    vision deficiency. This test is for informational purposes only. If you believe you may have a color
                    vision deficiency please consult an eye care professional.Results may vary depending on many factors
                    including the type and quality of your device display, and operating system configuration. Before
                    starting the test, turn off any software that may alter the screen color. Blue light filtering
                    software (such as Night Shift and f.lux) may cause the test to return a "tritan" classification.
                    Taking this test with colored glasses including "color blind glasses" may cause the test to return
                    an erroneous classification. To ensure accuracy of the result, remove any filtering eyewear or
                    lenses.</p>

                <summary class="summary">What are the Various Types</summary>
                <p>There are four main types: Red-Green, Blue-Yellow, and Full (Monochromacy). Each color vision
                    deficiency results from specific eye defects or abnormalities that affect how an individual sees
                    color. For example, individuals with the Red-Green type are less sensitive to color variations in
                    the spectrum's red and green regions. Individuals with the Blue-Yellow type may not distinguish
                    between hues such as cyan or blue-yellow. And people with Full (Monochromacy) Type have difficulty
                    seeing any color.</p>

            <details>
                <summary class="summary">What Causes Color Blindness</summary>
                <p>There are several different types, but the most common type is caused by an altered or absent color
                    of Photopsin pigment in the eyes. It will also be caused by other conditions that affect the eyes,
                    such as cataracts or macular degeneration. Most of all, it is hereditary but can also be acquired
                    through illness or injury. It is relatively common, affecting up to 8% of men and 0.5% of women
                    worldwide. While it is not a severe condition, it can impact a person's ability to participate in
                    certain activities, such as driving or identifying colors in a work environment. There are several
                    ways to adapt to color-blindness, including color filters and special glasses by consulting a
                    doctor.</p>

                <summary class="summary">Can Color Blind People Drive</summary>
                <p>Driving is a most difficult skill, allowing people to navigate the roads safely and access work,
                    school, and other destinations. However, not everyone has this ability. Some people suffer from
                    color blindness, making it difficult to differentiate some colors and combinations. Many have
                    wondered whether color-blind drivers are safe to drive on the road, but this question depends on
                    their particular type of color blindness. For instance, color blindness can be detected with a
                    simple online test. Regardless of the cause, all color blind drivers can benefit from taking extra
                    care behind the wheel and being especially careful by consulting to doctor and taking Treatment like
                    glasses or lenses while driving.
